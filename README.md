I recently found an amazing resource to learn Solidity Programming called Crypto Zombies. Its developed by the Loom Network.
Its completely free and truly an awesome experience.

# In this repository, I have attached all the files I coded during the course of this tutorial. 
From inheritance to overflow and underflow handling using Safe Math, all the basics and advanced topics of Solidity were pretty much covered.

Everyone trying to learn Solidity language should definitely try out this resource. I have attached the link below.
